# Video Store CLI

Once upon a time in ye olden days to watch a movie a person had to head down to their local video store and rent a video.  We are going to step into the shoes of this old timey retro video store owner and build for ourselves all of the tools that we need in order to run our successful corner video store. 

You have already built a [Video Store API](https://github.com/AdaGold/retro-video-store) for the backend in Part 1 of the project.

In keeping with our retro vibe, for this part of the project we will build a Command Line Interface (CLI) for the front end.

## Review

There are no tests for the CLI. Have fun with it! You use use the [user stories](ada-project-docs/part-2/user_stories.md) to guide its functionality. Instructors will review the CLI and provide feedback on how it addresses the user stories and user experience. We recommend that you find a partner to "play-test" your CLI and put it through its paces.
